  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    I'm Fred (Rongfei) Shao, a Data Science and Applied & Computational Math student at USC with a strong foundation in backend engineering, infrastructure automation, and data analysis.
    I’ve contributed to large-scale system reliability projects, including BDMS at UCloud—enabling one-click deployment and lifecycle automation for Kafka, Etcd, and Elasticsearch, reducing delivery time from 3 days to 0.5 hr across 176 clusters and 600+ nodes.
    I’ve also built cost analysis pipelines and improved reliability across MySQL, MongoDB, and RocketMQ, and received UCloud’s internal Luban Award (鲁班奖) for innovation and impact.
