    title: "A New Method to Reduce Near-Infrared Data of Palomar Observatory",
    venue: "International Conference on Applied Physics and Mathematics (ICAPM)",
    date: "May 25, 2022",
    link: "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2287/1/012037",
    abstract: `
Compared to large optical spectral surveys, near infrared spectra are overwhelmingly outnumbered.
Using data from the Palomar 200-inch telescope (P200) with the TripleSpec NIR spectrograph,
we developed a new automated data reduction pipeline that recovers previously ignored spectral
orders, extends wavelength coverage from 1–2.5 μm to 0.9–2.5 μm, and improves median SNR by a
factor of 2. The pipeline generalizes to other NIR instruments and will be released alongside
over 200 newly collected quasar spectra.
