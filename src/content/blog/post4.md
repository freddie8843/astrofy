Graduating from **Pickering College** marked the conclusion of four formative years that played a significant role in shaping who I am today.

From **September 2019 to June 2023**, Pickering provided an environment that encouraged both academic excellence and personal responsibility. The school’s close-knit community allowed me to grow not only as a student, but also as a leader and collaborator.

During my time at Pickering, I was actively involved in several extracurricular activities, including the **Robotics Team**, **Math Club**, and the **Cybersecurity Team**. These experiences strengthened my interest in engineering, systems, and problem-solving, and taught me how to work effectively in team-based, technical settings.

Beyond clubs, I had the privilege of serving as a **Head Proctor** and participating in the **Student Committee**, where I learned the importance of accountability, mentorship, and contributing positively to the community. These roles helped me develop leadership skills that continue to influence how I approach teamwork and responsibility today.

I am deeply grateful for the friendships, mentorship, and opportunities Pickering College provided. The lessons I learned during these four years extend far beyond the classroom and continue to guide me as I move forward into university and my professional journey.

Pickering College will always remain an important chapter in my life, and I look back on my time there with appreciation and pride.
