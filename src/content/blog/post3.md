Last summer, I accepted an offer to join UCloud as a Site Reliability Engineering Intern, marking an important milestone in my technical journey.

This role represented my first formal exposure to production-grade cloud infrastructure and reliability engineering in a real-world, high-impact environment. Joining the SRE team allowed me to work closely with large-scale distributed systems, automation pipelines, and operational tooling that support critical business workloads.

During the internship, I contributed to the BDMS platform, where our work helped reduce deployment time for distributed systems from multiple days to approximately 30 minutes. Beyond the technical growth, the experience gave me a deeper understanding of how reliability, efficiency, and observability intersect in production systems.

I’m especially grateful to my supervisor Nash Chang, mentor Carl Jin, and teammate Sanshi He for their guidance and support throughout the summer. Their mentorship shaped not only my technical skills, but also how I think about system ownership and engineering responsibility.

Looking back, accepting this offer was a pivotal step that confirmed my interest in Site Reliability Engineering and laid the foundation for my continued growth in large-scale systems engineering.
