That concludes an incredible summer at **UCloud**.

As an SRE Intern, I gained hands-on experience working on **high-stakes, large-scale cloud infrastructure**.

I worked on the **BDMS platform**, helping reduce deployment time for distributed systems from  
**3 days → 30 minutes**.

The highlight was our team winning the **internal Luban Award** for the project.

Huge thanks to my supervisor **Nash Chang**, mentor **Carl Jin**, and teammate **Sanshi He**.
